# Ant-Colony-Optimization

This is a parallelized application, implementing the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In ACO, artificial ants explore a parameter space to discover the optimum solution by keeping track of their positions and solution quality, comparing routes travelled by various ants, and renewing pheromone concentrations at each edge.
I have leveraged parallel computing techniques to enhance the efficiency and speed of the algorithm by 90%, enabling the solution of larger and more complex instances of TSP
